# Hodoku Translation

This is a translation of the Hodoku project from Java to Python. The initial goal is to translate it from the original source code to Python 2 using the java2python repo located here: https://github.com/natural/java2python.

Once the desired sections of the code are translated (namely the techniques), we'll again update the Python2 code to Python 3.
